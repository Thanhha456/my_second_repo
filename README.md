      *CENTRAL PARK - LAKE*
Bloom and Bialystock are on the wooden rowboat and Bialystock is laying baxh with his ferr crossed on the side. Bloom is sitting up with his feet in the water and his pants rolled to his knees.

*Bialystock* 
-  Lovely out here isn't it?

*Bloom*
- I wish I could enjoy it. I'm so nervous. What if someone from the office should see me?

*Bialystock*
- You'd see them. And why aren't they at the office?

*Bloom*
- That's right.

*Bialystock*
- That's Leo. You are learning. Having a good time?

*Bloom*
_ I don't know, I feel so... strange.

*Bialystock*
_ Maybe you are happy.

*Bloom*
_ That's it. I'm happy.

Puts his hand into his head. 

*Bloom* (CONT'D)
